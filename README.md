This library is not professional like it could seem to be. Actually, is part of
project made by me for a class named "Lab of Algorithms and Data Strutures" of
University of Naples "Federico II".
In this library you'll find everything [or maybe not] about Abstract Data Types like:

    * Vector
    * List
    * Stack
    * Queue [represented as List and Vector]
    * Binary Tree [represented as Link and Vector]
    * Binary Search Tree
    * Matrix with some representations like Compressed Sparse Row [CSR] and
      represeented as Vector.

Of course, this shit has nothing to do with what you'll really do
professionally, so take it like an hint for studying and learning.it like an
hint for studying and learning.

Enjoy!!
